Change log
==========

Next version
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Future-proofed the library a bit by emitting JSON blobs instead of multiple
  script tags when using more than one orderable on one admin page.


0.20 (2024-11-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added french translations. Thanks to Foucauld Degeorges!
- Added a new option to reorder items by clicking instead of dragging. Thanks
  to Foucauld Degeorges!


0.19 (2024-10-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for automatically renumbering the objects on page load. Add
  ``ordering_field_renumber_on_load = True`` to your model or inline admin
  definition to opt into this behavior.
- Dropped Python 3.8, 3.9 from the CI.
- Dropped Django 4.1 from the CI.
- Added Django 5.1 to the CI.
- Added Python 3.13.


`0.18`_ (2024-05-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _0.18: https://github.com/matthiask/django-admin-ordering/compare/0.17...0.18

- Added Python 3.11, 3.12 and Django 5.0.
- Switched to hatchling and ruff.
- Added a database index to the ordering field.


`0.17`_ (2023-05-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _0.17: https://github.com/matthiask/django-admin-ordering/compare/0.16...0.17

- Fixed descending orderings.
- Added Django 4.2.
- Updated the bundled jQuery UI version.
- Changed the CSS and JavaScript to fix the handle selection. Do not mark the
  whole row as draggable. (This was never intentional.)
- Removed the ``mouseup`` and ``mousedown`` handler which fixed the width of
  cells during dragging. It seems to break file inputs inside sortables in
  Firefox. Breaking is worse than a potentially worse UI.


`0.16`_ (2022-09-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _0.16: https://github.com/matthiask/django-admin-ordering/compare/0.15...0.16

- Stopped warning when ``ordering = ["-ordering"]``.
- Added Django 4.1.
- Raised the minimum version of django-js-asset to 2.0 for better compatibility
  with new Django versions.


`0.15`_ (2022-02-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _0.15: https://github.com/matthiask/django-admin-ordering/compare/0.14...0.15

- Updated the bundled jQuery UI library to 1.12.1.
- Added a system check which verifies that ``admin_ordering`` is added to
  ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
- Added system checks for the ordering attribute of models.
- Added pre-commit.
- Raised the minimum version of Python to 3.8, Django to 3.2.
- Changed the ``formset:added`` handler for compatibility with Django 4.1.


`0.14`_ (2021-03-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _0.14: https://github.com/matthiask/django-admin-ordering/compare/0.13...0.14

- Specified the default ordering by ``["ordering"]`` in the
  ``OrderableModel``.
- Started adding translations.
- Switched to a declarative setup.
- Switched from Travis CI to GitHub actions.
- Added comparison operator support to ``OrderableModel`` so that instances may
  be sorted in Python code.


`0.13`_ (2020-10-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added Django 3.1 and Python 3.8 to the matrix.
- Added an abstract ``admin_ordering.models.OrderableModel`` model.


`0.12`_ (2019-11-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a notice to the README that using django-admin-ordering with
  filtered and/or paginated changelists may produce unexpected results.
- Checked compatibility with Django 2.2 and 3.0.
- Made the ordering field selector more specific to avoid an edge case.


`0.11`_ (2019-03-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Also reformatted ``setup.py`` using black and updated the Trove
  identifiers a bit.
- Added an explicit dependency on ``django.jQuery``.


`0.10`_ (2019-01-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added automatic detection of formset's prefixes; now adding more than
  one inline per model is supported and explicitly specifying
  ``fk_name`` is not needed anymore.
- Reformatted the frontend code using prettier and added checking by
  ESLint.


`0.9`_ (2018-08-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an accidental global ``data`` value in the JavaScript code.
- Added a default of ``extra=0`` for avoiding problems with empty but
  still invalid inlines.
- Fixed a duplicated handle when using ordering fields with callable
  defaults.
- Reformatted the code using black.


`0.8`_ (2018-01-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following changes were contributed by Fabio Caccamo:

- Preserved the placeholder height when dragging starts.
- Added support for a descending ordering field, e.g. for a priority
  field.
- Added a handle for reordering items, ghosts of objects when dragging,
  and generally made the display of placeholders much nicer.
- Added support for hiding the ordering input field.


`0.7`_ (2018-01-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed the package to not install the test suite app when installing
  using pip. Thanks to Melvyn Sopacua for the contribution!
- Fixed an elusive bug with our formsets handling. Newly added content
  blocks have to be saved before they can be reordered.
- Extend item selector to work with stacked inlines on Django > 1.9.
  Thanks to Fabian Germann for the fix.
- Use tox for running tests and style checks.
- Fixed the package to work with the new ``forms.Media`` merging
  introduced in Django 2.0.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a testsuite.


`0.1.1`_ (2016-04-08)
